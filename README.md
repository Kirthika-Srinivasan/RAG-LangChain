# RAG-LangChain – Production-Style Retrieval Augmented Generation System

A production-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built using LangChain, vector search and Large Language Models, with evaluation, re-ranking, latency tracking and an API layer.

This project demonstrates real-world AI engineering practices for LLM and RAG systems.

## Overview:

This project implements an end-to-end RAG system that:

- ingests local documents

- generates embeddings

- performs hybrid retrieval

- re-ranks retrieved contexts

- generates grounded answers using an LLM
